# FaBCustomCardCreator

This is for when you want to make a crap ton of custom cards but do not want to write out every single one.

The program will read in an Excel file and output multiple PNGs that will contain the cards

The structure for Excel is as follows: Name, Card Type, Cost, Pitch, Power, Defense, Effect 1, Effect 2, Effect 3
 - In the repo there is an example Exel file for you to go off of.
